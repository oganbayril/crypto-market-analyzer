# Crypto Market Analyzer üìà

A comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis tool that fetches real-time data from the CoinGecko API to analyze market trends, price movements, and generate insightful visualizations for the top cryptocurrencies by market cap.

## Features

üîç **Market Cap Analysis**
- Display top N cryptocurrencies by market capitalization
- Show current prices and market cap values
- Real-time data fetching from CoinGecko API

üìä **Daily Price Tracking**
- Generate detailed graphs showing 30-day price movements
- Display both absolute price changes and percentage changes day-by-day
- Interactive visualizations for better data interpretation

üìà **Performance Overview**
- Create summary graphs showing total 30-day percentage change
- Compare starting prices (30 days ago) with current prices
- Clear visualization of overall performance trends

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (see Installation section)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oganbayril/crypto-market-analyzer.git
cd crypto-market-analyzer
```

2. Install required packages::
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the `crypto_market_analyzer.ipynb` file

3. Execute all cells in order by clicking "Run All" or run cells individually

### Customization

You can customize the analysis by modifying these parameters in the notebook:

- **Number of coins**: Change the `top_n_coins_input` parameter to analyze more or fewer cryptocurrencies
- **Time period**: Modify the date range for historical data analysis
- **Visualization style**: Adjust graph colors, sizes, and styling options

## API Information

This project uses the **CoinGecko Public API** which provides:
- Real-time cryptocurrency data
- Historical price information
- Market capitalization data
- No API key required for basic usage

**API Rate Limits**: CoinGecko's public API has rate limits. The code includes appropriate delays to respect these limits.

## Output Examples

The analyzer generates three main types of output:

1. **Market Cap Table**: A formatted display of top cryptocurrencies with their market cap and current prices

2. **Daily Price Charts**: Individual graphs for each cryptocurrency showing:
   - 30-day price movement timeline
   - Daily percentage changes
   - Price trend visualization

3. **Performance Summary**: Overview charts displaying:
   - Total 30-day percentage change
   - Starting vs. current price comparison
   - Performance ranking among analyzed coins
